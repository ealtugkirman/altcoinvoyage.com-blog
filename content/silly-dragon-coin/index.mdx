# Silly Dragon ($SILLY)

The unveiling of [Silly Dragon](https://sillydragon.io/) went beyond mere concept during Halloween 2023. Anatoly Yakovenko, Co-Founder of Solana, greeted conference-goers in full Silly Dragon attire, breathing life into the playful character. This whimsical yet meaningful occasion signified the official debut of Silly Dragon, a figure poised to make a lasting impact on the Solana ecosystem.

## Latest Updates about Silly Dragon
In November 8, 2023, Anatoly shared on his X account that the upcoming Year of the Dragon in 2024 is ushering in a delightful and playful vibe to the Solana narrative. As we approach 2024, traditionally linked with the dragon in diverse cultural zodiacs, there's growing anticipation for the potential narratives and innovations inspired by the Silly Dragon. This whimsical symbol holds the promise of being a catalyst for fresh, creative initiatives and heightened community engagement, contributing an intriguing dimension to the ever-evolving Solana storyline.

On December 25, Yakovenko, Solana's co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs, humorously suggested in a tweet that Solana might be seen as an Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solution thanks to its Wormhole eigenlayer. This playful remark came as a witty response to a tweet listing various L2 solutions, including Arbitrum, Aztec, and Polygon. His quip humorously implied, "Solana is Ethereum! Through the Wormhole eigenlayer, Solana operates as an Ethereum L2. Once danksharding is scaled up, there's no limit to submitting all Solana blocks into a data-validating bridge contract on Ethereum."
