# Ondo Finance: Bridging TradFi and DeFi

*Published on January 31, 2024*

The term "Real World Asset" is a composite phrase that has been experiencing significant growth in recent times, enabling the smooth flow of capital between the realms of Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Within this burgeoning field, Ondo Finance has emerged as a prominent and noteworthy entity deserving of attention.

## 1. Ondo Finance: An Overview

> Ondo Finance represents a decentralized financial platform with a keen focus on the orchestration of Real World Assets (RWA). Leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology, Ondo has meticulously constructed an infrastructure system for investment characterized by transparency, efficiency, and accessibility, particularly catering to institutional clients. Fundamentally, Ondo Finance aspires to function as an on-chain investment bank meticulously tailored for institutions, with its central emphasis squarely on Real World Assets.

## 2. Ondo Finance Products and Mechanisms

The project comprises two integral products, namely Liquidity as a Service (LaaS) and Structured Products.

### 2.1. Liquidity as a Service (LaaS)

Ondo Finance stands as the pioneer platform to introduce the innovative concept of LaaS, which stands for Liquidity as a Service. LaaS extends its support to token issuance projects by autonomously bolstering the liquidity of their native tokens on decentralized exchanges. Furthermore, token issuers are able to accrue transaction fees, thereby mitigating temporary loss risks and capital expenses.

The operational procedure unfolds as follows:

A project can deposit its tokens into the Ondo liquidity pool, thereby enjoying a flexible timeframe. Subsequently, Ondo matches this deposit with an asset pool of equivalent value, which is provided by one of its esteemed partner entities, including but not limited to Frax, Fei, Angle, Paladin, Near, among others, forming a liquidity pair. This liquidity pair is then dispatched to a designated decentralized exchange for the purpose of farming. Upon maturity, Ondo retrieves the liquidity along with the farming profits onto its platform. Consequently, the assets, in conjunction with the initially specified fixed interest for the partner entity, are returned, with the remaining portion being remitted to the project.

### 2.2. Structured Products

This particular product affords cryptocurrency investors the opportunity to engage in trading endeavors that encompass both risk and asset rewards. By depositing funds into Ondo Finance with a predetermined interest position, be it of low-risk or variable interest nature, high-risk, investors are able to actively participate in this product, thereby accommodating both traditional investors and seasoned DeFi enthusiasts.

The procedural mechanics can be encapsulated as follows:

When the Vault becomes accessible, users can proactively deposit assets into either the Fixed Tranche Pool or the Variable Tranche Pool, thereby setting the stage for profit accumulation over a specified time frame. Upon the culmination of a predetermined period, the Vault is subsequently closed, and the liquidity of equal value from both pools is harnessed to form a liquidity pair. This liquidity pair is dispatched to platforms such as Uniswap or Sushiswap for the purpose of farming. Upon maturity, Ondo Finance executes the withdrawal of liquidity from the aforementioned decentralized exchanges, inclusive of the farmed yield. Subsequently, the platform effectuates the return of assets with fixed interest to the depositors situated within the Fixed Tranche Pool, with the residual portion being remitted to depositors in the Variable Tranche Pool.

### 2.3. Real World Asset

In the year 2023, Ondo Finance made the strategic decision to cease the development of product lines associated with Liquidity as a Service and Structured Products. This pivotal shift was undertaken to redirect the organization's focus towards Real World Assets, thereby ushering in an era where users worldwide can access an array of products, including but not limited to U.S. government bonds and corporate bonds.

## 3. Ondo Finance Protocol

The protocols engineered by Ondo Finance are meticulously designed to eventually operate autonomously, dissociated from Ondo itself. Each protocol boasts its distinctive web app interface hosted on a discrete web domain, governed by an entity that operates independently from Ondo's purview. Consequently, when users interact with any of these protocols, they are redirected to a separate browser window/tab, overseen by external entities. Comprehensive information concerning each individual protocol can be readily located on their respective websites.

## 4. The Team behind Ondo Finance

The esteemed team responsible for the development and operation of Ondo Finance comprises 22 key members, all of whom bring to the table a wealth of experience in both the traditional financial sector and the realm of DeFi. Some notable figures within the team include:

- Nathan Allman: Founder & CEO, who boasts experience garnered from renowned entities such as ChainStreet Capital, Prospect Capital Management, and Goldman Sachs.
- Justin Schmidt: Chairman & COO, a seasoned professional with a diverse background encompassing Merrill Lynch, WorldQuant LLC, LMR Partners, Seven Eight Capital, Goldman Sachs, and Talos.
- Romain Bourgois: Product Director, a seasoned professional with over eight years of experience, predominantly in technology-focused companies like Criteo.

## 5. Ondo Finance Investor Relations

Ondo Finance has effectively secured a total sum of $46 million through a series of successful funding rounds. In its most recent funding round, conducted through the Coinlist platform, the project successfully raised $22 million at a token price of $0.055, with active participation from the community.

Preceding this, Ondo had triumphed in a successful Seed round, securing $4 million, with Pantera Capital leading the way, alongside DCG (the company behind Grayscale), CMS Holdings, and several other Angel Investors.

The Series A funding round, transpiring in April 2022, proved to be instrumental in garnering $20 million in capital, with prominent figures such as Pantera Capital and Founders Fund spearheading the initiative. Distinguished participants in this round included Coinbase Ventures and Wintermute, among others.
