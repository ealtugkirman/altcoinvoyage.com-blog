# Discovering ZKFair (ZKF) – A Revolutionary ZK-Rollup on Polygon CDK and Celestia

## Reducing Data Expansion and Gas Costs

ZKFair leverages Celestia's modular Data Availability (DA) to scale data, substantially decreasing gas costs for users interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) within the ZKFair ecosystem. This integration improves data availability, lowering costs for users engaging with distributed applications.

## NCRC 2.0 Protocol for Atomic Cross-Rollup Communication

ZKFair adopts the Native Cross Rollup Communication (NCRC) 2.0 protocol, a pivotal development enabling atomic cross-rollup communication. Developed by Lumoz, this protocol allows ZKFair users to directly interact with dApps on Ethereum, fostering interoperability across different second-layer networks. NCRC 2.0 enhances cross-contract invocation, providing users with expanded functionalities.

## Decentralized Prover Network Powered by Lumoz

ZKFair's future plans include integrating a decentralized prover network, showcasing a commitment to decentralization. This Lumoz-powered network allows community members to run ZKFair, ensuring a shift towards complete decentralization for a more robust and secure ZK-Rollup ecosystem.

## USDC as Gas Token

ZKFair stands out by utilizing stablecoin USDC as its native gas token. This strategic choice creates a secure and stable environment for participants in DeFi transactions, contributing to enhanced liquidity and interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## ZKF Token – The Heart of ZKFair's Ecosystem

ZKF, the native token of ZKFair, plays a pivotal role in the project's ecosystem. With a fair launch, ZKF tokens are airdropped to the community immediately after the mainnet launch, promoting fairness and inclusivity. ZKFair's unique approach ensures that 100% of L2 Gas Fee revenue is returned to the community after ZKF token circulation.
