# Fetch.ai (FET): An Overview 

FET is the designated token linked with Fetch.ai, an innovative blockchain project aiming to establish a decentralized digital realm. It stands as one of the tokens currently included in the Metaverse Index (MVI) maintained by Index Coop.

## What is Fetch good for?

Fetch.ai is a pioneering blockchain project designed to establish a decentralized digital environment, enabling autonomous software agents to undertake meaningful economic tasks on behalf of individuals, businesses, and organizations. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), Fetch.ai aims to provide intelligent solutions within the realm of blockchain technology.

### What is FET?

At the core of Fetch.ai's ecosystem lies the FET token, an ERC-20 utility token serving as the backbone of the network. It functions as the medium of exchange for transactions and computational services within the Fetch.ai ecosystem. FET, introduced in 2018, plays a pivotal role in powering the network.

### Is Fetch.ai a Layer 1?

Fetch.ai serves as both a layer-1 Ethereum proof of stake (PoS) network and an interchain protocol based on the Cosmos-SDK. It also uses a WASM-based smart contract language that allows builders to deploy applications on the network.

### Who is the founder of FET coin? Who owns Fetch app? Is Fetch a Chinese company?

Fetch.ai was co-founded by Humayun Sheikh, Toby Simpson, and Thomas Hain. Humayun Sheikh, the CEO, is an innovative entrepreneur who played a crucial role in providing early-stage funding for DeepMind before its acquisition by Google. Toby Simpson, the COO, previously served as a lead developer for the popular video game "Creatures" and has extensive experience in applying artificial life (Alife) and AI in the realms of entertainment and technology. Thomas Hain, the CSO, is a professor at the University of Sheffield, possessing profound expertise in machine learning and AI.

## FET Tokenomics

Fetch.ai employs a dynamic token model meticulously crafted to bolster a self-sustaining economy of agents. The total supply of FET tokens is limited to 1.15 billion. FET serves as the primary medium of exchange on the platform, essential for accessing, developing, and operating autonomous agents within the network.

## Inclusion of FET in MVI

The incorporation of FET into the Metaverse Index (MVI) aligns with the index's objective to mirror the trends in Metaverse and Gaming activities within virtual economies driven by blockchain technology and NFTs. This shift replaces the prior focus on capturing entertainment, social activities, and businesses in virtual economies also powered by blockchain technology and NFTs.

Fetch.ai's distinctive fusion of blockchain and AI sets it apart in the cryptocurrency landscape. Through its autonomous agents, the platform endeavors to automate various tasks and processes across sectors such as transportation, supply chain, healthcare, and more. The expansive potential for automation and optimization, facilitated by the FET token, underscores the project's substantial significance. FET fulfills all inclusion criteria outlined by MVI.

## Fetch Smart Ledger

The Fetch Smart Ledger constitutes the blockchain layer of Fetch.ai, integrating distributed ledger technology with a directed acyclic graph. All network transactions undergo processing within this layer.

### Fetch.ai Price Prediction 2024



With the anticipated crypto bull run in 2024 and Fetch.ai being recognized as a leading "AI coin," it is poised for considerable investor interest. Given its market cap below $200 million and its reputation as one of the premier AI cryptocurrencies, FET holds potential for significant upside.

Additionally, being listed on major tier-one exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase enhances accessibility for investors, augmenting its potential in a bullish market.

The project's commitment to expanding its ecosystem is evident through consistent tool releases, exemplified by a recent hackathon held in partnership with DeCodeCafe. Hackathons play a pivotal role in fostering a developer community and enhancing a project's ecosystem.

Fetch.ai's "AI agents," capable of swift development from legacy applications through the project's no-code service, offers extensive utility potential. This aspect positions Fetch.ai as a promising candidate to be among the top-performing cryptocurrencies.

Considering a Fortune Business Insight report forecasting a 23.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the blockchain and AI market between 2020-2027, Fetch.ai stands to benefit from significant upside potential in the upcoming bull run, especially considering its current -81.08% from its 2021 ATH.

Taking these factors into account, our Fetch AI price prediction estimates a potential low of $0.35, a high of $0.6, and an average price of $0.475 by the conclusion of 2024.
