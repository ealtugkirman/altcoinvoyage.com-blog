# Explained: DENT - All You Need to Learn

## What is DENT

> DENT, with a mission to liberate mobile data by helping people avoid the
costs associated with telecommunications fees, is designed to empower
individuals. Additionally, it allows you to earn money from your unused
data that is returned to a mobile operator when your plan expires.

The Dent Platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and has a native
ERC-20 token called DENT. Mobile data packages come in the form of smart
contracts. The DENT mobile application is currently available for iOS
and Android devices, boasting more than 7 million users worldwide.

DENT\'s peer-to-peer network disrupts the rules of the game among
existing telecommunications operators in three ways:

1\. It eliminates all data roaming costs due to exorbitant routing
setups between telecoms.

2\. Both individuals and telecommunications companies can use DENT to
engage in mobile data trading, paving the way for a new and more
inclusive data-sharing economy.

3\. Individuals and IoT devices can automate the purchasing process and
seize the best opportunities in the region by using DENT for
transactions.

## What DENT Does?

DENT aims to address the issue of global mobile traffic, which,
according to Cisco, exceeded \$32 billion in 2017 and continues to grow.
Many telecommunications users find themselves constrained by data
options. Regardless of the data package purchased, it typically expires
within one or two months. Meanwhile, most users either have insufficient
or excessive data usage within their plans.

The developers of DENT recognized the need to liberate mobile data by
allowing users to purchase, earn, and spend their data as they desire.
Such an innovative vision has created a brand-new market worth \$4.8
billion, adding much-needed flexibility to mobile data usage and plans.

## How Does DENT Work?

DENT is comprised of various cutting-edge technologies that come
together to allow users to engage in mobile data exchange. The key
components include the DENT Exchange, Ethereum smart contracts, a mobile
and a web application, and virtual operators.

Fundamentally, DENT cannot operate without a broad consumer base. You
may be aware of the highly competitive nature of the telecommunications
industry. No innovative telecommunications company can afford to miss
the opportunity to reach more customers. Therefore, the driving force to
attract telecom companies to the DENT ecosystem is the customers
themselves. The more users DENT has, the more profitable the platform
becomes for service providers. Additionally, every telecommunications
company joining the DENT market gets a chance to directly engage with
competing customers. 

### The DENT Exchange 
The DENT Exchange is the core component of the DENT ecosystem.
Essentially, the exchange is a trading platform with features
reminiscent of forex and similar markets. Here, users and third-party
telecom companies meet and make deals with the help of the Ethereum
blockchain. The exchange comprises seven components: the instrument
store, pricing data, portfolio management, market maker algorithms,
order management, order execution, and the DENT Exchange parachain.

### DENT web and mobile applications 
DENT web and mobile applications allow market participants to view the
order book, place orders, review price history, quotes, market depth,
and other relevant trading information. The mobile application is
essentially a simplified version of the web application.

### Ethereum smart contracts
Ethereum smart contracts execute DENT transfers based on events
occurring in the market.

### Virtual operators or telecommunications companies 
Virtual operators or telecommunications companies act as market makers.
They provide various data packages for DENT users and serve as payment
gateways for traditional Premium-SMS/USSD data package deals.

Having such a system enables DENT to facilitate three types of
transactions:

1\. User-to-user data transactions.

2\. P2P international data package transfers in roaming situations.

3\. Initial Data Offers (IDO) by telecom companies.

DENT\'s revenue comes from processing IDOs and fees collected through
spreads.

## DENT Team:

Founded in Hong Kong in 2014, DENT Wireless LTD embarked on developing
an automated Forex market system with embedded risk management
functions, led by Tero Katajainen. Drawing on his ideas and expertise,
the team created the DENT Marketplace to tokenize Telco Assets and
facilitate the buying and selling of mobile data packages, voice
minutes, and more.

In 2017, other founders joined Tero\'s venture, forming a team to
introduce DENT products and services to the world.

## Prons and Cons of DENT

### Prons

The project has a goal to create a market with an annual value of \$386
billion. Currently, there are no established second-hand data
marketplaces, and Dent aims to fill this gap. It addresses significant
inefficiencies in international roaming markets, offering a solution.
The availability of cheaper mobile data is likely to attract a large
consumer base. Dent already collaborates with approximately 20
telecommunications operators, and the rapidly growing mobile data market
further supports its potential success. If successful, Dent has the
potential to become a decentralized unit connecting cell phone
operators, benefiting both everyday consumers and the operators
themselves. Initiatives like Gigabytes for Africa contribute to positive
global impact.

### Cons

The project relies on cooperation from mobile operators, which may pose
challenges. The platform is not yet widely adopted, and its usage is not
extensive. Competitors in the crypto space, such as Telcoin, present
challenges. Currently, mobile operator support is limited to only 14
countries.
