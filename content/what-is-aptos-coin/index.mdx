Aptos (APT) is a layer 1 blockchain utilizing the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, positioning itself among prominent layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. The question arises: why introduce another layer 1 blockchain into the mix?

Aptos distinguishes itself by concentrating on Web 3.0, a pivotal stage in technological development often referred to as the "new Internet." Web 3.0 encompasses all economic services, products, and applications constructed on the blockchain, including DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, and cryptocurrencies, with decentralization being a core tenet of Web 3.0.

Aptos aspires to streamline the adoption of Web 3.0 by addressing key issues found in other blockchains, such as the blockchain trilemma (scalability, security, and decentralization), along with enhancing usability.

The Aptos mainnet was launched on October 17, 2022, enabling developers to craft smart contracts using the Move programming language. This language ensures secure and swift execution of smart contracts, facilitating a high transaction throughput through parallel processing.

Additionally, Aptos implements various techniques to optimize performance and decentralization, incorporating a validator reputation system in transaction processing. These efforts aim to position Aptos as a faster, more secure, and scalable alternative to its competitors.

## What can you use Aptos (APT) for?

Aptos supports the development of smart contracts, allowing developers to construct decentralized applications on the Aptos blockchain. Developers can also create and operate cryptocurrencies on Aptos, making it a versatile platform for both developers and end users. Aptos claims to provide secure, fast, and cost-effective applications, differentiating itself from competitors facing challenges with the blockchain trilemma.

## Who are the founders of Aptos?

Mo Shaikh serves as the CEO and co-founder of Aptos, leveraging previous experience as the Director of Strategy at ConsenSys, a prominent blockchain company. Avery Ching, the CTO and co-founder, brings over a decade of software development experience to Aptos, previously holding the position of vice president at Apache Giraph.

## Who are Aptos' competitors?

Aptos faces competition from various layer 1 blockchains, including Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Avalanche (AVAX), as well as layer 2 scaling solutions like Polygon (MATIC), Optimism (OP), and Arbitrum, and other layer 1 projects such as Moonbeam (GLMR) and Astar (ASTR).

## The APT coin

APT serves as the native cryptocurrency of Aptos, functioning as the fuel for the blockchain. Transactions on Aptos require the APT coin for payment, and validator nodes earn APT through staking, contributing to transaction processing and block creation.

## Tokenomics of Aptos

Aptos boasts a total supply of 1,000,000,000 APT coins, with 130 million tokens in circulation at the mainnet launch on October 17, 2022. The distribution includes allocations for the community, team, consultants, private investors, foundation, and general investors.
