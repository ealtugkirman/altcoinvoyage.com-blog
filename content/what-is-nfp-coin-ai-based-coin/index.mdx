Binance has recently listed **NFPrompt**, an AI-powered platform for Web3 content creators, along with its native token **NFP**. NFPrompt offers a comprehensive ecosystem that combines art and commerce, while the NFP token plays a central role in the platform with various functions such as staking, payments, community rewards, and governance.

## NFPrompt Overview

### What is NFPrompt?

NFPrompt is a platform developed based on Web3 in a period when artificial intelligence (AI) technology is rapidly advancing and widely adopted. Positioned as a tool that enables users to create content using AI tools and generate income through these contents, NFPrompt platform allows users to create their own content in everyday life through AI-supported tools and tokenize their artworks by verifying ownership using blockchain technology.

NFPrompt aims to provide a new channel for expressing creativity and earning economic gains for ordinary users through the integration of AI and Web3 technologies.

### NFP Coin Overview

**NFP Coin** is defined as the native token of the NFPrompt platform, a cryptocurrency. Initially, 1,000,000,000 NFP tokens are planned to be minted at the genesis (start) of the project.

NFP Coin supports the ecosystem of the platform by taking on various roles in activities, community participation, and governance within the platform.

## Key Features

### Fair Launch Mechanism

NFPrompt believes that providing a fair start for all participants in the project is one of the standout advantages. This means both new investors and experienced market participants can share in the success of the project, strengthening the sense of mutual benefit within the community.

### Decentralized Token Distribution

In the early stages of the project, the token ratio held by those with a significant portion of the NFP supply is deliberately kept low. This allows for more tokens to be allocated to the creators in the community and gives the community more control over the direction of the project.

### Long-Term Project Commitment

The team is dedicated to building a sustainable and long-term project. To demonstrate commitment, the team voluntarily extended the token vesting period for both the team and key users, ensuring the healthy functioning and stable development of the ecosystem.

### Community Long-Term Support

The long-term success of the project depends on active community participation and support. Therefore, introducing public scrutiny and voting mechanisms for token usage based on community governance was decided.

### Fair Token Distribution Model

NFP's token economy model aims to distribute tokens fairly to everyone contributing to the project. Users, content creators, collectors, and KOLs play a significant role in the project.

### Credit Mechanism

To create NFTs and mint them on NFPrompt, users must spend 1 credit for each creation. Earned credits play a crucial role in sharing from the management token pool.

## NFP Coin Utility

NFP Coin facilitates users in creating AI-supported content on the NFPrompt platform and minting them as NFTs. It allows content creators to earn royalties from their works and provides governance rights on the platform.

Users can earn a share of transaction fees on the platform by staking NFP tokens and can influence future decisions of the platform.

## NFP Coin on the NFPrompt Platform

Let's examine in more detail, point by point, what NFP Coin does on the NFPrompt platform.

### Content Creator Incentives

NFP Coin encourages users to create dynamic and intuitive digital content on the platform. While creating various content such as images, videos, animations, PFP avatars, music, and 3D models, users can finance their creations using these tokens and mint them as NFTs.

### Loyalty Mechanism

For unique artworks and content created on NFPrompt, there is a loyalty fee mechanism for the original content creator. When a user's prompt is reused, the copyright fees from the works generated by that prompt are transferred to the original content creator, preserving the uniqueness of the content and the value of the creator's effort.

### Community Governance

NFP Coin holders can have a say in the platform's features, development, and other crucial decisions. Users with a certain number of tokens can make suggestions for improving the platform and actively participate in community decisions.

### Exclusive Access and Auctions

NFP Coin is required for participation in future private auctions of popular artists. Users can stake their tokens for access to exclusive art pieces.

### Transaction Fee Sharing

Users staking tokens have the right to earn a certain percentage of the total transaction fees on the platform. A higher amount and longer lockup period result in a higher share.

## The Future of NFP Coin

The future of NFP Coin looks promising as artificial intelligence continues to evolve, and the integration of Web3 technologies increases. Platforms like NFP Coin offer tools to help users derive economic and creative benefits from this transformation as AI's role in content creation, digital art, and community governance expands.

With innovative usage scenarios, growing user acceptance, and the security and transparency provided by blockchain technology, NFP Coin will continue to play a significant role in the content creator economy and digital asset management.

However, in the event of a reverse scenario, where developments negatively impact the platform, this could reflect negatively on the price of NFT Coin. Therefore, it is important to have more information about the platform and determine the level of risk before investing in NFP Coin.
