# MetisDAO: Decentralized Solutions for Ethereum

## What is MetisDAO all about?

MetisDAO (METIS) is an Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution designed to address the blockchain trilemma, the challenge of achieving decentralization, security, and scalability simultaneously. It tackles Ethereum's primary hurdles, including speed, cost, and scalability, providing a platform for developers to create and manage decentralized applications (dApps). Incorporating the Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework into its Layer 2 infrastructure, MetisDAO aims to facilitate the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.

## How does MetisDAO operate?

MetisDAO utilizes Optimistic Rollups to enable fast and cost-effective transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This approach bundles multiple transactions into a single processed transaction on Ethereum, optimizing affordability and speed while leveraging Ethereum's security and decentralization. Unlike traditional systems storing transaction data on layer-1, MetisDAO keeps most of its transaction data off-chain, resulting in significantly cheaper storage costs compared to Layer 1. The platform offers a modular framework for developers to build and customize their dApps using Metis infrastructure.

## Potential Applications of MetisDAO

MetisDAO serves as both a Layer 2 scaling solution and a platform for building and operating decentralized autonomous companies (DACs). Through its DAOTribution Campaign, it provides a grants program for contributors and communities to initiate their DACs on KORIS, offering funding through the Metis token. Additionally, MetisDAO is developing a Hybrid Rollup, combining optimistic rollup architecture with zero-knowledge proofs, aiming to provide a developer-friendly Layer 2 for Ethereum developers to deploy diverse decentralized applications.

## Backstory of MetisDAO

Established in 2019 by Elena Sinelnikova, Kevin Liu, and Yuan Su, MetisDAO officially launched on November 17, 2021. Sinelnikova, with a background in blockchain, cybersecurity, and full-stack programming, founded other crypto projects, including the non-profit blockchain educational hub 'Crypto Chicks,' in 2017. Kevin Liu, with a background in investment management and strategic development, holds an undergraduate degree in management and an MBA from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Yuan Su, with a computer science background and an MBA from the University of Toronto, worked at IBM before co-founding Metis in 2019, currently overseeing development at CaseWare International.

## Investment Considerations
